Project name : Personnel Management System.
Category : SaaS (Software as a Service)
Domain : HRM - Human Resource Management
Components : Website, Mobile/Tablet apps, Call center 

Problem definition :
India has large resource pools of skilled and semi-skilled workforce personnel. They include unskilled/semi skilled professionals like labor for cotton picking, carrying building raw materials,cleaners etc. and skilled labor like construction workers (specialized), plumbers, electricians, carpenters, painters, technicians etc. While some of this workforce is literate and is somewhat organized around small groups/labor unions, most of them are illiterate and disorganized. In a majority of cases they also do not have access to technology or tools that can make getting continuous work easier with consistent income. This gives rise to multiple problems like skewed demand supply, labor exploitation by brokers, uneven wages and lack of consolidation for such a diverse and large group of workforce resource pools. There is a serious lack of a platform and toolset that will help optimize the process of 
Finding,hiring,paying,rating and reviewing from an end user perspective (Our secondary end user - Mr.Ravi shank’a’r who can't find a good plumber)
Managing, contracting, negotiating best rates and standardizing work quality from a service provider perspective (Our main end user - entrepreneur)
Solving problems around finding consistent work and getting paid based on skill and demand from a resource perspective (the guy whose life we can at least try to make a bit easier)

Existing solutions :
OLX, sulekha, word of mouth - hundred different ways which offer listing and some kind of mechanism to book the said resource. I could not find a platform that the idea that I am proposing intends to be. There could be one that I am not aware of, but this needs some research and case study. Someone has beat us to the game - http://www.servicemax.com/

Proposed Solution :
A comprehensive platform with multiple tools for all prospective end users - the consumer , the entrepreneur and the workforce resource. This platform includes tools that will include websites for listing and booking resources (a lot like OLX) , web applications that the entrepreneurs will use for managing all aspects around “resource mgmt” (a lot like work order mgmt tools like http://www.servicemax.com/ ), mobile apps that both ravi shankar and entrepreneurs will have that each will use for their customized needs. 

High level concept :
The platform will consist of multiple tools and applications :
A website where ravi shankar can register, look up for resources that meet his criteria - price, duration, rating, reviews,location etc and if he finds one - book the person , confirm appointment, get work done, pay the money and rate the worker and give feedback.
A mobile app where ravi shankar gets a condensed version of the same features offered by the customer website/web application .

A web application that Uday the labor contractor/25 yr old unemployed entrepreneur can register and use to start a small business where he will scout for skilled labor, gather their details, negotiate rates, probably sign agreements, and list them on the website for ravi shankar to find. He will be managing the work order, assigning it to the contractor, ensure he gets the job done. he will pay the contractor whatever he made agreement for - fixed or percentage. He will be liable for the quality of the work, guarantees service level agreements etc and collects and pays the worker.

A mobile app where uday gets a condensed version of the same features offered by the entrepreneur website/web application .

Dashboards that will give all kinds of metrics. Not to mention the tons of data that will be generated which we can use for all kinds of things and sell it coz we the company own it.

 Unique Value proposition :
The UVP is the comprehensive streamlined end to end solution platform. We are not selling bits and pieces or modules. We do end-to-end service. In the process we help in a small way in consolidating a highly fragmented , highly unorganized resource pool. This kind of tools try to address many big and complex problems around logistics and process optimization domains. It also tries to be a win-win for everybody as it increases transparency and encourages the optimization and over a period of time improves the process.  

Unfair Advantage :
We will be the first one to the field or at least one of the first players.If we can establish ourselves and cater to this niche, we can solve a big problem that has no well designed robust solutions. We will have a lot of opportunities to innovate and lead the change. Not to forget the tons of money that can be made in a hundred different ways.

Customer segments :
The ever frustrated tech savvy end user who has the money to pay  for services like maids, plumbers or painters - but has no tools that make this quest easier. The quintessential ravi shankar who has to struggle for 10 days to find a plumber because the only plumber in his street will not work for simple 1 day gigs - to fix his shower which ravi thinks is a 2 hr job and should cost about 500INR. 

The unemployed entrepreneur who has a degree in Bsc/BTech/MBA who knows how to find maids/plumbers/painters who are looking for 10 day gigs but are also willing to do 2 hr jobs as long as they get paid the same day.He is willing to take the hassle of negotiating rates with laborers, ensuring that they will show up for a gig once committed and are willing to collect money, take a small fee and pay the remaining to the contract maids/plumbers/painters.He is willing to pay us the company some small fees to be able to use all our tools, which make his job of managing the contractors and all the process streamlined.

The non tech savvy skilled/semi-skilled/unskilled contract worker who just wants to get up, have breakfast, go to work, get paid a decent wage and get on with his life. He ideally wants jobs that are at the same place for 5 years, but can compromise and work on 2 hr gigs provided they pay a little more than the 5 year gig because he is lowering his expectations. he doesn't care about all the nitty gritties of process optimization or logistics management. He knows the drill. The specs of the job (marathahalli apartment - fixing shower - need to get shit done in 2 hrs - will get paid 300 INR - if I screw it , I might not get another gig as i already screwed up last 2 jobs and my “quality rank - a metric that he invented” )

Early adopters :
Unemployed entrepreneur
Tech savvy end user
There are multiple opportunities for people to use it - Companies can train skilled labor and offer their services, independent contractors can list themselves and offer services, labor contractors can manage their workers more easily and in a perfect ideal case - everyone ends up being happy

Channels :
websites
web-applications
mobile-applications
data analytics channels for offline sale of data 

Cost Structure :
Intellectual :
Initial cost in terms of proper research and analysis of the scope of our platform and identifying and optimizing the process workflows of hiring and managing diverse workforce types.The process of hiring a maid is very different from hiring a plumber. This is pure business analysis - understanding the domain - and the most critical part - probably the most “cost” to us.

Technical:
Development effort - To actually architect, design and develop so many tools and applications.This is not a huge problem because we have the capability. Next biggest “cost” to us.
Marketing - To potential end users to convince them that this way is easier and better and reliable.We might not be the best but we can get people

Legal:
To handle any backlash from existing worker unions because we are essentially removing their power to lobby/bully and democratizing the process.
To handle issues around guarantees,contracts, etc. Again nothing that money cannot buy :D


Revenue Streams :
Subscription : Tech savvy end user
Subscription and/or commission : Unemployed entrepreneur
Revenue from ads for auxiliary services - search for painter - ad from paint company/hardware store
Sell data about consumer behavior to whoever is paying money. once we have data, we can do a lot of things here. 

Comments : 
Uday :
I see some potential problems :

Trying to build a comprehensive universal solution might prove more difficult than we think. But we can always pick some features and start from somewhere.
Getting the entrepreneur to make the effort to use the tool and give feedback.
Handle the exceptions to the rules - the special cases
Make a solution that is well architected, well designed and well developed. Its hard to get a small website or blog running - building a platform is a huge task - a daunting task that needs dedication.
Things that I cannot see because “I havent dealt with the labor people in India and things don’t work as I think they should :P “
07/08/15 : 
The main effort and our prime objective is to provide solutions that will standardize operations mgmt/process mgmt for domains where such standards are not well defined. The current providers might have their own implementations of such processes, but I am sure there will be scope for improvement. 
If we can find a way to streamline, consolidate and optimize processes - we have a huge potential to bring a positive impact on the way things are done in Indian way of life. At this point, I am being very idealistic and I dont know how practical our vision would be, but I have a very positive feeling.
And by providing tools, we avoid getting caught up in the complexities of actually managing these services/businesses like customer acquisition, order mgmt, risks associated with market fluctuations etc. If we can design a platform that is flexible enough to cater to a wide range of niches, we can pivot based on feedback. - to your point about being flexible : A highly modular micro service based architecture designed for a business model with a very narrow scope to begin with feels like a decent approach : any comments from your point of view ?
A lot of homework is needed to understand operations mgmt, workflow mgmt, efficient algorithms for scheduling, billing, rating and resource availability optimization in order to come up with a solid business model.
Sumanth : Do you foresee any potential problems in the concept other than existing players ? Gut feeling about the worthiness of pursuing this idea ? 
 

Sumanth:

There are players who ventured into market  who offer services (similar to what Uday pointed)  to end -users.
http://www.housejoy.in/ (Plumber, electrician, house cleaning, beauty services etc)
https://www.practo.com/  (doctor appointments, reviews)
https://www.vedantu.com/v/ (personal tutors)
These just came to my mind instantly. There are lots. In fact of late, you name a service/problem which can be offered/solved and there is startup somewhere working on that or launched a solution to market. Above listed start-ups are getting good reviews (currently). I’m sure there are many other sites offering same solutions, but have fizzled out due to lack of focus. Even some who were able to launch disappeared into thin air due to a buggy product or a bad UX or bad customer support. 

I think,  products targeted at end-users need strong focus on what problem we are solving for customers, good UX, competitive pricing, clear-cut & streamlined backend operations (for quick turnaround for customer requests and grievances). But products targeted at  businesses need more breadth and scalability which can result in large scale adoptions by businesses. For example, if one comes up with a solution for florists, that should be suitable (and scalable) to be adopted by any florist in the country. Else, it won’t reach the critical mass of adopters and hence no Return on Investment (ROI).
However one difference to notice here is, we may not be exactly solving a problem here, infact solving problem is for the business which uses them. We provide them a tools suite (web offering + mobile app typically) to implement their solution without they having to hire technical talent. “Tally” is a plain vanilla example.

Check this business model(this addresses both end-users and businesses),
https://www.practo.com/ - They are offering this service free for end users who look up for doctors & reviews and want to book appointments. And they have different offering “Pratice management software” https://www.practo.com/for-doctors - as a paid service to doctors. Needless to say the free service is indirectly fuelling the sales for the paid service. Doctors are billed I believe based on the user base (registered users) for this app and they pay expecting potential new visits for their practice based on the adoptions (or app downloads). Mutually complementing solutions isn’t it?
